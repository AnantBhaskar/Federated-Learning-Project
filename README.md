Implemented a CNN-based Federated Learning system for detecting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using a high-dimensional gene expression dataset with 16,000+ features and 500 samples.

Simulated federated training across 5 clients and 10 rounds, incorporating privacy-preserving techniques and weight aggregation.

Preprocessed the dataset by filtering out genes with >25% zero expression, reshaping for CNN input, and normalizing features.

Evaluated the model using ROC AUC, PR AUC, F1-score, and accuracy; visualized model performance through ROC and Precision-Recall curves.
